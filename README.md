Grade 11 Final Project game made using Unity Engine

I had made this game with a colleague over 2 years ago in the late months of 2015 to January 2016 as a school project. This game uses a lot of free assets for animations and textures. 

I worked on the animation, player interactions with the enemy and player health.
